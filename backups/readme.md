# Backups

## Server binary
You can find here original and cracked server binary files backup.

Cracked server binary files credits goes to "Kung Foo Man" and "Mitch" from killtube: https://killtube.org/showthread.php?1719-Latest-cod2-linux-binaries-(1-0-1-2-1-3)

It might be usefull if you want to create a server to play on without a valid CD key. 
But you won't need this as you did buy the game, didn't you ? 
  > if you didn't, [this thread](http://killtube.org/showthread.php?1337-CoD2-Tutorial-How-to-make-your-cracked-server-show-up-in-the-master-list) might help your pervert mind create a masterlist-visible-pirate-uberawesome server.

It is recommanded to use the `cod2_lnxded_1_3_patch_va_loc` as it is the latest cracked version available.

## Library
The gcc3 library was used as a workaround on Ubuntu before finding a proper solution to add 32 bit gcc libraries using official repositories (issue dicussed [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/454253/how-to-run-32-bit-app-in-ubuntu-64-bit/454254#454254)). 

It is not used anymore but will stay here as a backup, just in case it would not be supported in the future.
