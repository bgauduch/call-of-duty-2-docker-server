# Call of Duty 2 server meets docker

Launch a minimal & lightweight containarized [Call of Duty 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_2) multiplayer game server, including libcod.

## üì¶ Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

This repository uses automated CI/CD with semantic versioning to provide images for all server binaries located in the [`/bin` folder](https://github.com/bgauduch/call-of-duty-2-docker-server/tree/main/bin).
All image tags can be found on the [Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bgauduch/cod2server/tags).

### Tagging Strategy

**For production use, always pin to immutable tags (full semver + variant) for reproducibility.**

#### Mutable Tags (updated with new builds)

* **`bgauduch/cod2server:latest`** - Latest build from `main` branch (COD2 1.3 nodelay_va_loc variant)
* **`bgauduch/cod2server:4`** - Latest major version 4.x.x (all variants)
* **`bgauduch/cod2server:4.2`** - Latest minor version 4.2.x (all variants)
* **`bgauduch/cod2server:4.2.0`** - Specific version (all variants)
* **`bgauduch/cod2server:1_3_nodelay_va_loc`** - Latest build of specific server variant

#### Immutable Tags (never overwritten - recommended for production)

* **`bgauduch/cod2server:4.2.0-1_3_nodelay_va_loc`** - Full semver + server variant

#### Server Variant Format

* **`X_Y_zzzzzz`** where:
  * **`X_Y`** is the COD2 server version: [`1_0`, `1_2`, `1_3`]
  * **`zzzzzz`** is the server binary type (e.g., `_nodelay_va_loc`, `_cracked`, etc.)
  * See [readme in the `/bin` folder](https://github.com/bgauduch/call-of-duty-2-docker-server/tree/main/bin) for variant explanations

**Example usage:**

```yaml
# Production - use immutable tag
image: bgauduch/cod2server:4.2.0-1_3_nodelay_va_loc

# Development - use latest
image: bgauduch/cod2server:latest
```

> Full credits goes to them for their awesome work !

## üìù Requirements

* The original game, as its content is used by the dedicated server;
* A host machine of your choice with x86_64 architecture;
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed and configured on your host machine. Minimal knowledge in using both is recommended.

## üöÄ Usage

### Setup the server

1. Clone or download this repository on your host machine;
1. Copy required data from the `main` folder of your original game (install directory or retail DVD) to the server:
    1. Copy all the `iw_XX.iwd` from 00 to 15 to the `cod2server/main` folder;
    1. Copy all the localizations `localized_english_iwXX.iwd` to the `cod2server/main` (it might be another language).
1. Edit the config file located in `cod2server/main/server_mp.cfg` to suits your needs:
    1. **[MANDATORY] Set the RCON password to something strong and private!** See [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) for security best practices.
    1. Tweak the rest as you see fit, don't forget to update the placeholders (server name, admin, etc).
1. *[Optional]* If you need Punkbuster:
    1. Activate it by changing `sv_punkbuster` from `0` to `1` in the command arguments of the `docker-compose.yaml` file;
    1. Edit the `cod2server/main/punkbuster.cfg` configuration to suits your needs.
1. *[Optional]* Edit the `bgauduch/cod2server` image tag in `docker-compose.yaml` to choose a different server version;
1. Depending on your setup, you might have some port-forwarding and firewalling to do in order to make your server publicly available (see required open ports in the `EXPOSE` section of the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/bgauduch/call-of-duty-2-docker-server/blob/main/Dockerfile)).

### Launch the server

From the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Server interactions

From the project root, you can:

* Restart the server (to pick up config change for instance):

  ```sh
  docker-compose restart
  ```

* Tail the server logs:

  ```sh
  # cod2_server refer to the name of the service in the compose file
  docker-compose logs -f cod2_server
  ```

* Attach a shell to the server to run commands, see available commands in [/doc/readme.md](https://github.com/bgauduch/call-of-duty-2-docker-server/blob/main/doc/readme.md):

  ```sh
  docker container attach call-of-duty-2-docker-server_cod2_server_1
  # exemple commands
  status
  map_rotate
  # Use the escape sequence to detach: `CTRL+P`, `CTRL+Q`
  ```
  >
* Completely stop the server:

  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```
