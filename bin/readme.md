- `1_0a`, `1_2c`, `1_3`: server version for compatibility with your game
- `nodelay`: changes the minimum required master server offline time before you can connect to an original server (from ~30 minutes to 5 seconds)
- `cracked`: disable the master server + "nodelay"
- `loc`: no spam of non-localized strings
- `va`: patch for string overrun in call to va() function (more than 1024 chars), can be considered a security patch and should be used

Use the one that fit your needs.
